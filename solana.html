            <h2>What is Solana?</h2>
            <p>
                Solana is a decentralized blockchain platform designed for scalability, high throughput, and low transaction costs. It was built to overcome the limitations of existing blockchain solutions, particularly in terms of speed and scalability. Solana's promise lies in its ability to support large-scale decentralized applications (dApps) and cryptocurrencies without sacrificing security or decentralization. Unlike Ethereum and Bitcoin, which struggle with scalability and high transaction fees, Solana’s unique architecture enables it to process up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), making it one of the fastest blockchains to date.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="how-it-works" class="section">
            <h2>How Solana Works</h2>
            <p>
                Solana's consensus mechanism is a hybrid of Proof of History (PoH) and Proof of Stake (PoS). While traditional blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum rely on PoW (Proof of Work) or PoS alone to validate transactions, Solana combines PoH and PoS for unparalleled efficiency.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Proof of History (PoH):</strong> Proof of History is Solana's breakthrough innovation. It timestamps transactions before they are included in blocks, creating a verifiable and consistent record of events. By creating this historical record, Solana reduces the time needed to validate transactions, significantly improving throughput. PoH functions as a cryptographic clock, which allows nodes to sync more efficiently without needing to compare and verify timestamps across the entire network, as seen in other systems.</p>
            <p><strong>Proof of Stake (PoS):</strong> The PoS mechanism is used to select validators who are responsible for verifying and confirming the transactions. Validators stake tokens to participate in the validation process, and the more tokens they stake, the higher their chances of being selected to validate a new block. This method not only secures the network but also incentivizes participants to act honestly since malicious behavior would result in losing their staked tokens.</p>
            <p>
                Together, PoH and PoS enable Solana to achieve lightning-fast transaction speeds while maintaining security and decentralization. This is a stark contrast to traditional Proof-of-Work blockchains like Bitcoin, which require enormous computational power and high energy consumption to validate transactions.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="comparison" class="section">
            <h2>Solana vs. Other Blockchains</h2>
            <p>
                Solana's key differentiator is its speed and scalability. Compared to Ethereum, which can only process around 15 transactions per second, Solana can process over 65,000 transactions per second, allowing it to handle large-scale applications and micro-transactions without delays. The low fees on Solana (usually fractions of a cent) are another important advantage over Ethereum, where gas fees can spike during periods of high network congestion. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When compared to Bitcoin, Solana is also far more scalable. Bitcoin's Proof of Work consensus mechanism requires miners to solve complex cryptographic puzzles, which leads to long confirmation times and high energy consumption. On the other hand, Solana's PoS combined with PoH enables much faster and more efficient validation processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, Solana is built to support decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi projects, and NFTs with seamless speed and efficiency, positioning it as a strong competitor to Ethereum for the next wave of blockchain innovation.
