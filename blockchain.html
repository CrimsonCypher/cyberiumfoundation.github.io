            <h2>What is Blockchain?</h2>
            <p>
                Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions in a secure, transparent, and immutable way. It operates without a central authority or intermediary, meaning that all transactions are validated by a network of computers (or nodes). 
                Each block in the chain contains a set of transactions, and these blocks are linked together chronologically, forming a continuous chain. Once a block is added to the blockchain, it is nearly impossible to alter, making the system highly secure.

            <h2>How Blockchain Works</h2>
            <p>
                A blockchain works by using cryptographic hashing to secure data. Each block in the chain contains a unique identifier, called a hash, that is created using a mathematical function applied to the data in the block.
                <br>
                When a new block is created, its hash is calculated and linked to the hash of the previous block. This chaining of hashes creates an unbreakable link between the blocks, ensuring that the data in the blockchain is secure and cannot be altered retroactively.

            <h2>Benefits of Blockchain Technology</h2>
            <p>
                Blockchain technology offers numerous benefits that make it ideal for cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, supply chain tracking, and many other applications. These benefits include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> No single entity controls the network, making it resistant to censorship and manipulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> The cryptographic nature of the blockchain makes it highly secure against fraud and tampering.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Blockchain's public ledger ensures that transactions are visible to anyone, promoting transparency and trust.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Transactions on the blockchain are typically faster and cheaper than traditional methods, as they donâ€™t require intermediaries.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="use-cases" class="section">
            <h2>Use Cases of Blockchain Technology</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cryptocurrency:</strong> Blockchain is the underlying technology behind all cryptocurrencies, ensuring secure and transparent transactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Contracts:</strong> Blockchain can automate contract execution, allowing two parties to enter into agreements that are automatically executed once conditions are met.</li>
                <li><strong>Supply Chain:</strong> Blockchain can track goods as they move through the supply chain, providing transparency and ensuring authenticity.</li>
                <li><strong>Voting:</strong> Blockchain can be used for secure, transparent digital voting systems that ensure the integrity of election results.</li>
            </ul>
