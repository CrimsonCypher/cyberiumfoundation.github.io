            <h2>What is Cryptocurrency?</h2>
            <p>
                Cryptocurrency is a type of digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies operate in a decentralized manner using blockchain technology. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cryptocurrencies are typically used for peer-to-peer transactions, enabling users to send and receive funds across borders without relying on banks or other financial intermediaries. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are some of the most popular cryptocurrencies, each with their unique features and use cases.

            <h2>Crypto Wallets: What They Are and How They Work</h2>
            <p>
                A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital tool that allows users to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies. There are two main types of wallets: hot wallets and cold wallets.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Hot Wallets:</strong> These wallets are connected to the internet and are typically used for everyday transactions. Examples include software wallets and mobile apps like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Phantom Wallet. Hot wallets are convenient but less secure because they are susceptible to hacking.</p>
            <p><strong>Cold Wallets:</strong> These are offline wallets, such as hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor. Cold wallets are more secure because they are not connected to the internet, making them less vulnerable to cyber-attacks. However, they are less convenient for frequent transactions.</p>
            <p>
                Wallets store private keys, which are used to sign transactions and prove ownership of the cryptocurrency. It's important to never share your private keys with anyone, as they grant access to your funds.
            </p>

        <section id="sending-receiving" class="section">
            <h2>Sending and Receiving Cryptocurrency</h2>
            <p>
                To send cryptocurrency, you need the recipient's wallet address. A wallet address is a long alphanumeric string unique to the recipient. It’s similar to an email address, except that it’s used for receiving cryptocurrency instead of emails.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you send crypto, your wallet will use your private key to authorize the transaction. Once the transaction is verified by the network, it is added to the blockchain. This process usually takes a few minutes depending on the blockchain you are using (Bitcoin transactions may take longer compared to Solana due to Solana’s higher throughput).
            </p>

        <section id="regulations" class="section">
            <h2>Regulations and Compliance</h2>
            <p>
                Cryptocurrencies are subject to varying regulations depending on the country in which they are used. In many countries, regulatory bodies are still figuring out how to classify cryptocurrencies and what legal framework to apply. Some countries have embraced cryptocurrency and created regulatory frameworks that allow for its legal use, while others have imposed bans or restrictions.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) play a role in regulating cryptocurrencies. The SEC has primarily focused on whether a cryptocurrency is a security, while the CFTC has treated cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as commodities. In addition, governments worldwide are looking at anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) laws to prevent illegal activities such as money laundering.

            <h2>Cryptocurrency Security</h2>
            <p>
                Security is a critical aspect of cryptocurrency, as the digital nature of the asset makes it susceptible to hacks and theft. There are a few key practices to keep your crypto secure:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Private Keys:</strong> Never share your private keys with anyone, as they give access to your funds. Store them securely, preferably offline.</li>
                <li><strong>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> Always enable 2FA on any platform that offers it. This adds an additional layer of protection when logging into your accounts.</li>
                <li><strong>Cold Storage:</strong> For long-term storage of large amounts of cryptocurrency, consider using a hardware wallet (cold storage). These are safer than hot wallets, as they are not connected to the internet.</li>
            </ul>
