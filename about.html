            <h2>The Future Token: Aims & Governance</h2>
            <p>
                The Cyberium Foundation is preparing to launch its own native token to power the foundation's ecosystem and ensure decentralized governance. The goal of this token is to empower the community, enabling users to participate directly in the decision-making process, vote on proposals, and contribute to the direction of the foundation's projects.
            </p>
            <h3>Key Features of the Future Token</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Governance:</strong> Token holders will be able to participate in governance through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). They will have the ability to vote on key issues, such as project funding, future developments, and protocol upgrades.</li>
                <li><strong>Staking:</strong> Token holders will be able to stake their tokens to support the network's security, receive rewards, and contribute to the growth of the Cyberium ecosystem.</li>
                <li><strong>Incentives:</strong> The token will act as an incentive mechanism for users who contribute to the foundation’s education initiatives, participate in community events, and engage with the ecosystem in meaningful ways.</li>
                <li><strong>Fundraising:</strong> The token will play a crucial role in fundraising for future Cyberium Foundation projects, enabling us to support further education and research in the crypto and Web3 space.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This token will not only be a means of exchange within the Cyberium ecosystem but also a powerful tool to align the interests of all stakeholders. By leveraging decentralized governance, we are building a system that puts the control back into the hands of the community, creating a more transparent and equitable future for all.
