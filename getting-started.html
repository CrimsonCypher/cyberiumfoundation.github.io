            <h2>Step 1: Understanding Cryptocurrency and Wallets</h2>
            <p>
                Before you can dive into the world of cryptocurrencies, you need to understand the concept of a "wallet." A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital tool that allows you to store, send, and receive digital currencies securely. Wallets come in two forms:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hot Wallets:</strong> These are software wallets connected to the internet, making them easy to use but more vulnerable to hacks. Examples include MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Phantom Wallet.</li>
                <li><strong>Cold Wallets:</strong> These are hardware wallets that store your private keys offline, providing an extra layer of security. Popular examples include Ledger Nano and Trezor.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="phantom-wallet" class="section">
            <h2>Step 2: Setting Up Your Wallet</h2>
            <h3>Hot Wallet Setup: Phantom Wallet</h3>
            <p>Phantom is an excellent hot wallet for Solana users. Here’s how you can set it up:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Download the Phantom Wallet extension from the official website (https://phantom.app) or your browser’s extension store.</li>
                <li>Create a new wallet by following the on-screen instructions.</li>
                <li>Write down the 12-word recovery phrase that is shown during the setup process. Store it safely offline.</li>
                <li>Set a strong password for accessing your wallet and click “Create Wallet” to finish the setup.</li>
            </ol>

        <section id="ledger-wallet" class="section">
            <h3>Cold Wallet Setup: Ledger Nano</h3>
            <p>For greater security, use a cold wallet like the Ledger Nano S or X. Here’s how you can set it up:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Purchase the Ledger device from the official Ledger website.</li>
                <li>Plug the device into your computer and follow the on-screen instructions to create a PIN.</li>
                <li>Backup the 24-word recovery phrase securely offline.</li>
                <li>Install the Ledger Live app on your computer and set it up to manage your assets.</li>
                <li>Transfer your crypto assets to your Ledger wallet for secure storage.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Step 3: Buying Cryptocurrency</h2>
            <p>
                Once your wallet is set up, you’re ready to buy cryptocurrency. There are two main methods for purchasing crypto: using a centralized exchange or trading directly with other users through P2P platforms.
            </p>
            <h3>Method 1: Using a Centralized Exchange</h3>
            <p>
                Centralized exchanges (CEXs) are platforms where you can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. Here’s how to buy crypto using Coinbase:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Create an account on Coinbase or another centralized exchange.</li>
                <li>Verify your identity and link your bank account or credit card for deposit.</li>
                <li>Choose the cryptocurrency you want to buy (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana) and select the amount.</li>
                <li>Confirm your purchase and transfer the crypto to your wallet for safekeeping.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Method 2: Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Trading</h3>
            <p>
                Peer-to-peer platforms like LocalBitcoins and Paxful allow you to buy crypto directly from other users. Here’s how you can buy crypto via P2P:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Sign up for a P2P trading platform and select the cryptocurrency you want to buy.</li>
                <li>Browse offers and select a seller who offers a good price and payment method.</li>
                <li>Initiate the transaction and pay the seller using your preferred payment method.</li>
                <li>Once payment is confirmed, the crypto is released from escrow and sent to your wallet.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Step 4: Storing Your Crypto Securely</h2>
            <p>
                After buying your crypto, it’s important to store it securely. Here are some tips for storing your crypto safely:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hot Wallets:</strong> These are convenient for daily use but should only contain small amounts of crypto that you plan to trade regularly.</li>
                <li><strong>Cold Wallets:</strong> For long-term storage, cold wallets are more secure as they are offline and less prone to hacks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Always keep your private keys and recovery phrases secure. Never share them with anyone, and ensure your backup is stored in a safe, offline location.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 5: Staying Safe and Managing Risks</h2>
            <p>
                As with any financial system, cryptocurrency comes with risks. Here are some tips to help you stay safe in the crypto world:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> This adds an extra layer of security to your exchange accounts and wallets.</li>
                <li><strong>Be Wary of Scams:</strong> Always verify the authenticity of emails, websites, or offers that ask for your private information or recovery phrase.</li>
                <li><strong>Double-Check Addresses:</strong> Before sending crypto, make sure you’re sending it to the correct address, as transactions are irreversible.</li>
            </ul>
